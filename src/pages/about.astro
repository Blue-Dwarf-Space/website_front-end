		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			Australia wants to build sovereign space capability, but we keep 
			hearing from the space sector how difficult and expensive it is to 
			gain permits to perform space activities. Far from a simple 
			application, there is a whole hierarchy of documentation required 
			before you even get to that part. Some of these documents are 
			dependent on others, requiring special attention to the order and 
			timing of applications, resulting in further costs (financial and 
			time). There are no guarantees the final application will contain 
			all required information, requiring a revisit to some aspects of 
			the earlier works. There is a significant pain point involving 
			repetition of effort, much confusion, time, and cost.
		</p>
		<p>We can simplify it all</p>        
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>So why are *we* doing it?</h2>
		<p>
			Because it is hard, confusing, costly, and time consuming. These 
			things can be a block to incredible innovation...
		</p>
		<p><b>BUT...</b></p>
		<p>
			Safety is important. We need to ensure our access to space is 
			sustainable, done in a manner that doesn't destroy launch capabilities 
			for everyone. 
		</p>
		<p>This is about ensuring our future in space.</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Gaining access to perform space activities can be a complex process</h2>
		
		<p>information about the complexity of the process</p>
		<p>
			Leave the tedium and confusion to us; we see some red tape and we
			want to paint it black.
